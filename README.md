# Image Inpainting with Kandinsky Decoder

Inpainting replaces or edits specific areas of an image. This makes it a useful tool for image restoration like removing defects and artifacts, or even replacing an image area with something entirely new. Inpainting relies on a mask to determine which regions of an image to fill in; the area to inpaint is represented by white pixels and the area to keep is represented by black pixels. The white pixels are filled in by the prompt.

## Technology Used

For this project, the user has utilized the model "kandinsky-community/kandinsky-2-2-decoder-inpaint" for image inpainting. They have also employed masking techniques to add background images.

## Running the Code

To run the code, it is recommended to use a T4 GPU. The user has provided a [Colab notebook for demonstration](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16BObDwd57G6pboSnbjihzuG11HW-vK8w?usp=sharing).

## Future Improvements

If there are resources available, the user plans to add a better model to improve the results. They also mention that the Hugging Face free tier is only available for 2vCPUs, so running the code on GPU is essential for optimal performance.
